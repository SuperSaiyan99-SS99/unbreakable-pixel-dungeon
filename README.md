Pixel Dungeon
=============

## v1.9.2a

This is the official source code in terms of functionality based on decompiling the apk of
Watabou's Pixel Dungeon v1.9.2a. This also attempts to maintain the spacing, wording, and
styling from the rest of the code for consistency and to look like what Watabou might've
actually written himself. I was quite thorough when comparing the decompiled apk of v1.9.2a
to the decompiled apk of v1.9.1 that came from compiling the code that was uploaded to GitHub,
but if there are any differences that I missed, please create a GitHub issue for them.

## Unbreakable

This mod of Pixel Dungeon removes degradation from weapons, armor, rings, and wands in v1.9.2a.
These items no longer take damage and have a durability bar, and as a result, the Auto-repair
glyph and Tempered enchantment are removed as well as all methods of repairing these items.
